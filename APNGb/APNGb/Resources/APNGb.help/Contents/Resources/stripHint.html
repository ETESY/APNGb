        A strip image is a image that consists of multiple frames arranged in
        vertical or horizontal order.
        <br>
        The above example is a horizontal strip image which consists of 8 frames.
        <br>
        To use this option select the order option and input the number
        of frames to be extracted.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Hint:</b>
        <br>
        The number of frames that was input doesn't need to match the actual
        number of frames that image has.
